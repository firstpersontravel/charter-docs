## Welcome!

**Charter is a tool for creating, operating, and scaling your immersive experience, no coding required.**

Charter emerged from First Person Travel's groundbreaking immersive weekend adventure, ["The Headlands Gamble"](https://www.firstperson.travel/theheadlandsgamble), which combined live actors with location-based gameplay into a 48-hour long narrative adventure. Operating such a complex experience with minimal staff required new software capabilities, which Charter was built to provide.

Charter allows you to:
* **Reduce your staffing**: Script behaviors to reduce the need for staff monitoring and manually triggering events.
* **Design, test, and operate**: Prototype and iterate quickly with one tool, and verify that your experience operates as expected under any circumstance.
* **Scale your operations**: Charter provides a virtual command center, giving you a clear view of complex journeys including multiple groups of participants.
* **Handle variations**: Keep track of many schedules, itineraries, or variants of your experience. Assign groups to their variants and Charter handles the rest.

Whether you're making immersive theater, A remote live game, museum exhibits, escape rooms, retail activations, team-building activities, or mixed-reality games, we hope Charter can be useful for you!
