## Project

Charter projects are created in two main areas of the Creation interface: the "Project" area, which is described here, and the "Scenes" area, which is described on the next page.

The Project area covers all elements in your experience that are shared across the entire experience.

Scenes, on the other hand, are intervals in your experience that may differ greatly in how they operate. Aspects of your project that are only active during a particular scene are edited in the Scenes area of the creation tool.
