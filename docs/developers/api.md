Charter has a number of APIs and integrations that you can integrate with if you operate your own system.

## Authentication

You can get a day-long JWT token for accessing the Charter APIs from the login endpoint using your email and password (this example uses [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/)).

```sh
curl https://charter.firstperson.travel/auth/login \
  -s -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -X POST \
  --data '{"email": "EMAIL", "password": "PASSWORD"}' | jq -r .data.jwt
```

Use your token by passing it as a Bearer token using the authorization header in your requests; i.e. `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.

The login endpoint will also return the list of workspaces (or `orgs` in the API) that your user has access to. You'll need to use the numeric ID of your desired workspace as the `orgId` parameter in API calls.

```json
{
  "data": {
    "orgs": [{
      "id": 0,
      "name": "your-workspace",
      "title": "Your Workspace"
    }]
  }
}
```

## Rest API

Use the REST API for retrieving and making updates to Charter objects.

### General Usage

All endpoints accept query parameters in the URL for filters. Updates should be JSON-encoded in the body of your `PATCH` or `POST` request.

All endpoints require an `orgId` query parameter matching the numeric ID of your workspace. Many endpoints also require an `experienceId` parameter matching the ID of your project.

#### List

Use the list endpoint to query for a set of resources matching desired parameters.

* `count`: Number of records to return. Defaults to 250.
* `offset`: Offset used for pagination. Defaults to 0.
* `sort`: Sort by a specific field. Preface with `-` to sort descending.

You may pass in a field name to filter by values of that field. You can filter by numeric, string, date, or boolean values. You can search by multiple values by separating by commas.

* `GET /api/trips?orgId=1` will return all trips belonging to workspace `1`.
* `GET /api/participants?isArchived=false` will return all unarchived participants.
* `GET /api/participants?name=Alice,Bob,Charles` will return all participants with one of the three specified names.
* `GET /api/groups?date=2020-03-03` will return all run groups matching the specified date.

You may include range searches with operation suffixes: `eq`, `gt`, `gte`, `lt`, and `lte`. `GET /api/groups?date__gte=2020-03-03` will return all run groups equal to or after the 3rd of March.

#### Create

Calls to the create endpoint should include all fields JSON encoded in the POST body.

#### Retrieve

#### Update

Updates may be partial. Fields not included in the PATCH body will remain unchanged.
